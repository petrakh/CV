## Petra Chocholova

I’m a professional with 10+ years of experience in areas of sales, B2B and B2C marketing, strategy, finance, planning, project management and business administration, currently in a process of changing my career focus to IT development and coding. I’m hoping that my perseverance and ability to learn new things fast, combined with my passion for gaming and technology in general will ultimately prove that this career change makes sense - for me and your company, both :)

## Skills

#### Achieves effective solutions fast

Complex business situations are a great challenge for me and even though things can get quite stressful sometimes, I am able to navigate through uncertainty and make or support decisions that get me and the team to where the business needs us.

- I have successfuly launched a new MVNO into a market while acting as a project owner the project's finances, legal aspects, IT development, marketing, strategy and customer care
- I have led company-wide initiatives to increase performance in critical areas of a company, both by removing or limiting friction points inside the organization and by enhancing or restructuring the client value proposition

#### Relentlessly curious

I simply love learning new things and knowing everything I can about them. I'm an avid reader, listener and analyzer.

#### Plays well with others

While I'm perfectly fine working on my own, working with others is so much better. I believe a well-structured and responsibly led team is a back-bone of every company and I love being part of it and playing my part.
